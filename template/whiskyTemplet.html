            <p>
                As many people will know 1824 is a very significant year for the Scotch Whisky Industry, that was the
                year when whisky making truly flourished and became what we recognize today. A year before in 1823 had
                seen the Excise Act pass through Parliament making it much more worthwhile for the illicit distillers of
                the time to become legal and the industry to become more of what we recognize today.

                why Miltonduff
            </h3>
            <p>
                Situated in the Laich of Moray, just a few minutes from the county town of Elgin there was a number of
                illicit stills in the area but Miltonduff was the only one who became legal in 1824. Ideally located to
                take advantage of the locally grown barley, the distillery also has a wonderfully consistent water
                source taking water from the Black Burn which runs adjacent to the distillery.
            </p>

                <p class="first-p">
                    The Black Burn a few miles further upstream passes the ancient Pluscarden Abbey where the monks have
                    been brewing beer for centuries using the water from the burn.
                </p>
                <p class="second-p">
                    In 1964 there was also a pair of Lomond stills put into the distillery
                    producing a spirit know as Mosstowie, the name of local area around the distillery. The stills were
                    decommissioned in 1981 and replaced by another set of pot stills making three pairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2005 the distillery was purchased by Groupe Pernod Ricard and is
                    currently undergoing a very extensive upgrade. Miltonduff still remains one of the key malts in the
                    Ballantines family which itself is one of the most popular Scotch Whiskies in the world
